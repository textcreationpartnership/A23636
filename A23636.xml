            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>He directs his Epiſtle to us, giving his word for it (ſo far as it will go) that the book was written in good will to us; and if to <hi>ſlander</hi> and <hi>calumniate</hi> with bittereſt Invectives, may paſs for a Demonſtration, he hath proved his Love to be <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:</hi> and truly it is as much as we expect from one of his humour.</p>

               <p>He calls us to <hi>turn our minds to the Light of Chriſt within us,</hi> for our better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; we have done it as well as we can, &amp; it tells us, That his Aſſertions are bold, preſumptuous, and Haeretical.</p>
               <p>He tells us, It is the <hi>ſame ſpirit that gives to all Readers a right under ſtanding of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but if ſo, why then have not all the ſame underſtanding of it, but Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Can it be the Spirit of God, who is alwaies the ſame?</p>
               <p>He bids us to <hi>Believe in Chriſt, and joyn our minds to His divine Illumination, and He will anoint the eyes of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, &amp; we ſhall have our eyes open to ſee</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> If we will ſee of <hi>ourſelves,</hi> then He will give us Ability to ſee: this may be no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in a Quakers Logick.</p>
               <p>We have him alſo in a fit of <hi>Charity,</hi> (and we are beholden to him, for we ſhall not alwaies find him in ſo good a mood) granting that <hi>ſome of us may be in ſome ſenſe of the true Church;</hi> which how it ſhould

Only It is worth the while to obſerve, what a notable (and no doubt inſpired) Doctrine he recommended to us, viz. <hi>That the Quickning in a man, as it abides, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould periſh:</hi> To paſs the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of it (which muſt be allowed a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> or you undoe him) let us note its profoundneſe, If Grace <hi>continue,</hi> it cannot be <hi>loſt,</hi> a thing cannot <hi>be</hi> and <hi>not</hi> be at the ſame time; could <hi>Delphos</hi> have delivered a more myſterious Oracle?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>G.

               <p n="4">4. As to his next inſtance referring to our Enquiring and diſcovering what is the mind of God in our Carriage under His Hand, and in the management of our weighty Affairs; when he hath ſaid all he can, the Word of God, or the Scripture, is that which muſt ultimately reſolve us, That, to know What is Duty, depends on Divine Revelation, we are Agreed: That God did ſometimes reveal His Will <hi>extraordinarily</hi> to His Servants of Old, we deny not, but that the Word of God in Scripture is that which to us in Goſpel Times, ſince the Canon was perfected, Anſwers all the other wayes of Revelation is an Article of our Creed, and we think we have Scripture-warrant for it, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. &amp;c. As to the Caſe of <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> which he talks of, &amp; inſtanceth in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97428:15"/> carriage of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant, it is quite aliene to his purpoſe: for who ever aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God's providence is bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Scripture Rules, being ſupream &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary? But ſtill in our ſerving of this Providence, and knowing how to uſe it to His glory, and particularly to know what is the mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Where as he tells us, that <hi>Philip, Peter, and others, were extraordinarily called to ſuch and ſuch ſervices,</hi> it is readily replied, that That was extraordinary, and without warrant for us ordinarily to expect the like: moreover, the things they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, were ſuch as the Scripture ſatisfied them to be according to God.</p>
               <p>Finally, We deny not but that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth ſtill put an impulſe on the ſpirits of His people frequently, but is it ſelf-evident, or muſt not the Warrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it be tryed by Scripture-Rules?

               <p>Sect. 2. Here we have a great ſtir about the word <hi>(Logos,)</hi> but indeed a meer <hi>Logo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machy,</hi> and leſt he ſhould not have ſenſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to loſe it in, he falls into <hi>Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies:</hi> Somebody might do well to ask him, what different ſenſe he finds between, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Words, Talk,</hi> &amp; <hi>Speech?</hi> But the knack is, it ſignifies the Scripture only in a <hi>thirteenth rare &amp; improper ſenſe;</hi> and yet this is more than ſome of his friends will allow it.</p>

                     </gap> contains all the Word or Words of God?</hi> and that he denies, for the reaſons already giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, which are none at all: Well, if they will not ſet us down, he will try what Scripture-<hi>Metaphors</hi> will do; and now we muſt obſerve that <hi>The Word is compared to the</hi> Rain <hi>&amp; Dew,</hi> Deut. 32.2. <hi>and to</hi> Bread, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Now the drops of Rain &amp; dew, and the ſmall grain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of flower in bread cannot be numbred;</hi> ergo the Scripture contains not all the Word of God. But let us ask him (if he may be ſpoken to after ſuch a profound Revelation as this) whether he allows it to be a good Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture Alluſions, to apply all that is in the thing alluded <hi>to,</hi> to that which it is compared with? or is it more ſafe to reſtrain it to that particular thing for which the Compariſon was made? Why then may not the Word be Reſembled to the Rain &amp; Dew, for the <hi>fruitful Efficacy</hi> of it on the hearts of God's people? and to Bread, from the <hi>ſpiritual Nutriment</hi> it affords? wiſer men than <hi>G.

               <p>As to his 2nd, Queſtion, it is meer Quibling, We directly ſay, That <hi>The Scriptures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the revealed Will of God,</hi> which was Metaphorically, and <hi>Anthropopathos</hi> called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Let us not wrangle before we know what it is for. The Diſpute here is about the <hi>Judge or Rule of Controverſies in Religion:</hi> and obſerve, 1. That it is only about <hi>Matters of Religion.</hi> 2. That <hi>Judg,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard by which things are to be</hi> tryed <hi>and</hi> judged. 3. It refers to <hi>Controverſies,</hi> i. e. where <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> are in debate. Now wee'll ſuppoſe two kinds of Controverſies, one between <hi>men &amp; men,</hi> one party and another, each pretending to have truth on their ſide. The other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man &amp; <hi>himſelf,</hi> having a debate in his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97428:26"/> own mind, and not being as yet ſettled: The Queſtion then is, <hi>What (as a</hi> Rule) <hi>is to ſet men down, &amp; put an end to theſe Debates?</hi> and let us go together as long as we can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. He ſeems here to bid fair for an Agreement, at leaſt in the firſt ſort of the Controverſy, i. e. between men &amp; men, for we have only outwardly to deal one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and he aſſures us that <hi>the Scripture is the Touchſtone by which the Doctrine is to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and then ſurely it muſt <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> or what is the Advantage of Trying? Only he ſpoils all by telling us, <hi>They have a greater proof, viz. the inward Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We would only for the preſent ask him, (though that is not all we have to ſay to him) whether this inward Teſtimony be greater <hi>(as a rule)</hi> to judge another by, &amp; ſet him down? and this becauſe his words import that we are to judge by the Scripture whether the Teſtimony be from the Spirit or no; for in what other way can the <hi>Spirit of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets?</hi> elſe when a Quaker comes to tell us he hath a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and this is a Teſtimony above the Scriptutes, it would be <hi>impudence</hi> in <hi>us</hi> to <hi>ſearch</hi> the Scripture, if the thing <hi>revealed</hi> be ſo or <hi>no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What though the Spirit witneſſeth in us that this is the Rule, doth it hereby become
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97428:26"/> no Rule, or an inferior one? how abſurd!</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. Here alſo he begins fair, and would make us believe he is good natur'd, for he gives <hi>the Scripture a preference to all other Writings,</hi> and for that reaſon allows it to be <hi>a ſufficient</hi> outward <hi>Standard;</hi> and one would think <hi>that</hi> were enough to try Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between men and men, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, though his Reaſon is but awk; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Scripture-Writers had greater Meaſures of Wiſdome</hi> &amp;c. ſo that he allows them a gradual difference of Revelation, and not ſpecifical, which may be judged of by what hath been already ſaid, and what is it to us <hi>how</hi> or in what meaſures God revealed Himſelf extraordinarily to His Prophets, who pretend to no ſuch Revelation at all? It ſufficeth, that the loweſt degrees of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations were infallible, and therefore one Scripture is not leſs ſo than another: Nor ſhall we trouble our ſelves to preveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his <hi>Rabbinical Fopperies</hi> about the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of Revelation, by which (no doubt he hath raiſed his credit much with the poor blind Quakers; whereas indeed, if a man had ſtudied to make himſelf a <hi>Fool in print,</hi> he could not eaſily have done it more effectually; and though we grant, That <hi>God revealeth Himſelf gradually to His ſervants,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97428:27"/> and to</hi> ſome <hi>more than to others;</hi> yet his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. proves not what he brings it for; it intends not that the Fathers did not know the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (we find the Contrary, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14.26.24.27.20.) but that He did in His providence rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie Himſelf by the name of <hi>Almighty,</hi> in Protecting and defending of the Patriarchs, but now He would moſt eminently diſplay that of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the compleating of the promiſes which He had made unto them.</p>
               <p>In fine, he confeſſeth (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) That the Quakers degrees are <hi>ſo low that they are not in the ſtate of Perfection, but they may by humane frailty in ſome meaſure or way, more or leſs</hi> (tread ſoftly) <hi>decline or depart from the pure infallible teachings of the ſpirit;</hi> and then we hope this kind of ſpirit is not ſuperior to that which ſpake infallibly in the Scripture; and from which we are aſſured that the Prophets, and Apoſtles in their Dictating or Writing the Scripture, did not <hi>decline in any meaſure or way more or leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he infers from hence, that <hi>their Doctrine is to be tryed by the Scripture; and their ſpirit by the Spirit of Truth:</hi> We would ask him what Difference he here puts between Doctrine and Spirit; and let him (if he can) ſhew how their ſpirit is to be tried but by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97428:27"/> their Doctrine, or what Spirit they can be tryed by which will carry Conviction, but only that which breathes in the Scriptures: and it would be a great ſtroke he would drive, if he could reconcile our being led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly by the Spirit, to our being mean while in the ſame things left to miſtakes; which is the very ſenſe of his Words.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. Here alſo he will grant <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (or the Spirit ſpeaking in it) to be a</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge <hi>in a figurative ſenſe, ſo we do not reſtrain it hither, but allow Him to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> without <hi>Scripture:</hi> But this hath been already detected of vanity, for how ſhall we jugde of the Spirit, but by the Scripture? That the Spirit of God muſt open our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to diſcern the ſpiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of God, we never doubted; and that Prayer and Meditation are helps to it, who queſtions? But what's this to the purpoſe? In ſumme, the Spirit is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,</hi> but to call Him the <hi>Rule</hi> is Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. We had waited long to know the Reaſon why, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. S. 1. he calls the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>Outward Rule,</hi> and now he fairly tells us, viz. <hi>Becauſe the Spirit is the inward rule.</hi> i. e. <hi>To determine all Controverſies, at leaſt ſuch as we have in our ſelves a debate about.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97428:28"/> The Text alledged is impertinent, for the Teſtimony of God there ſpoken of is the Scripture witneſſed to by the Spirit: and we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Teſtator &amp; the Teſtimony, the latter of which can in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proper ſence be called the Rule, and let it here be well obſerved, That the Scripture is a Judge in it ſelf, and doth alwaies carry the Determination in it, whether we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it or no, ſo as to be able to make uſe of it as ſuch. And further, That it is not neceſſary that we have a <hi>ſaving Illumination</hi> for the meer <hi>Doctrinal</hi> improvement of it, ſince the Scripture is delivered in humane Language, and there is a logical knowledge of it to be attained by Induſtry, ſo far as to decide Controverſies in Religion, by ſuch as are not ſavingly illuminated, nor is it the ſpirit of the Diſputant, but the convincing light of the word of God it ſelf, which is to ſway our Judgements and ſet them down ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as to the Doctrine.</p>

He miſtakes the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he diſtinguiſheth between <hi>the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the letter and of the ſpirit,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 6. for that whole Context aſſures us, that by the <hi>Letter</hi> he means the <hi>Old</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and the Reaſon of his ſo Calling them, is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97428:30"/> thence eaſie to be gathered.</p>
               <p>His arguing the Neceſſity of Saving Grace becauſe, <hi>Spirtual gifts are requiſite,</hi> is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>illogical,</hi> nor doth it at all help him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe alſo were purchaſed by Chriſt, for he hath purchaſed other things for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Grace. That there is a ſpecifical Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Gifts and Grace, is certain, (though both may meet in the ſame man, &amp; we ſeek for both in every Miniſter, to the beſt of our diſcerning) that theſe are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is beyond doubt; that a man may have Grace, and yet not ſpiritual gifts <hi>G. K.</hi> (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly at leaſt) acknowledgeth; yet Chriſt <hi>purchaſed</hi> Gifts <hi>for men,</hi> not meerly for the Salvation, but mainly <hi>for the</hi> Edifying <hi>of the Body,</hi> we are told <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, 11. that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe a man muſt have ſpiriual gifts to make him a Miniſter, he muſt have ſaving Grace, is a <hi>Non Sequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 4. And that theſe <hi>ſpiritual Gifts were diſcernable</hi> we deny not. There is a fair &amp; eaſie Tryal to be made of them: but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that therefore <hi>They could diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men were true or falſe Aopſtles &amp; Teachers, ſincere or Hypocrites,</hi> is to be better weighed: That falſe Apoſtles might be proved by their falſe Doctrine. is nothing dubious: That Hypocrites might diſcover themſelves
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97428:30"/> by their fruits is alſo eaſy to acknowledge; but that in themſelves, without any ſuch Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and meerly by their looks, there was or is a ſpirit of immediate diſcerning them, is utterly untrue, neither hath he given us one Rule to direct us in it. As to his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.19. to prove this diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it helps him not, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks not there of their <hi>inward</hi> Grace, but of the fruits and effects of their Miniſtry, or of the Conformity of their Converſation to their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And whereas he cenſures us for <hi>Limiting one man to preach only,</hi> it is not true; we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of one to preach one part of the day, and another on the other part, where they are to be had: only we require that they be ſuch as are fit for the Miniſtry; and we would not have others to do it. Nor did the Apoſtle intend that there ſhould be any Confuſion in this Affair, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. &amp;c. and to very little purpoſe doth he quote 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. (though we ſee what he would be at) for that is not appropriated to Teachers, but applicable to all Profeſſors; nor did we ever plead that <hi>Scandalous</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters whoſe Converſation is contradictory to their Profeſſion &amp; Doctrine ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that Function, when once they are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97428:31"/> diſcovered to be ſuch. We therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to him, that there ought to be a <hi>Tryal of men,</hi> and (if he will too) that it is not <hi>meerly whether what they preach be true Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> but a great deal more; yet it muſt of neceſſity, be either of his Doctrine, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial gifts, or his Life, or rather all <hi>three;</hi> beyond which we are to ſeek of what Tryal can be made by <hi>men;</hi> for <hi>man</hi> judgeth and muſt judge, according to what can be known: and the <hi>Searching of the heart</hi> is <hi>GOD</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</p>

That becauſe we pretend not to <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> therefore we <hi>lay no claim to theſe ſpiritual gifts,</hi> is an Argument as vain as the author: Are there no Spiritual gifts but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations?</hi> are there not <hi>diverſities</hi> of them? ſee 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7.8. His Inference, That hence <hi>We plainly confeſs that we have no infallible Diſcerning who is gracious,</hi> we aſſent unto; and yet we do believe we can diſcern of this as much as <hi>G.

               <p>His Sophiſms in Charging us of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for ſaying, <hi>We have the Spirit of God,</hi> and yet ſaying, <hi>we have no</hi> infallible <hi>ſpirit;</hi> as if therefore <hi>we charged the Spirit of God Himſelf of being fallible,</hi> may ſeem to have ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon <hi>weak</hi> minds, (ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 41) it may therefore need a little Diſcuſſion: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve then, that the Evidence which we have within us of the Certainty of our ſpiritual State, or of any ſpiritual motions in us, is confirmed by two witneſſes, <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>our own,</hi> Rom. 8.16. and theſe are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct witneſſes, (the <hi>Quakers,</hi> indeed, have blaſphemouſly confounded them, and made them but one) now we acknowledged &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the witneſs of the ſpirit of God is <hi>Infallible,</hi> He cannot be deceived, neither will He deceive by witneſſing to a falſhood; but the witneſs of our <hi>own</hi> ſpirit is <hi>Fallible;</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:97428:33"/> becauſe we are perſons liable to miſtakes.

In both the Examination and Tryal we may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, for we know but <hi>in part,</hi> and yet ſo far as the Spirit of God confirms us by <hi>His</hi> Witneſs, we are infallibly aſſured.</p>
               <p>We find alſo, that the inſpired men of old (ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi>) did not declare all things to the people by <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> but ſome things as they were <hi>skilful underſtanding</hi> Chriſtians, influenced with the ordinary Aſſiſtances of the Spirit of God, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally Judging of things: Hence <hi>Paul</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12, — 25. and therefore the words alledged, verſe, 40. <hi>I think,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>His firſt proof that Miniſters can <hi>require no Maintenance but what is voluntary and of Charity,</hi> is from 1. Cor. 9.14.

Nor doth the Doctrine of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in the words of theirs which he Cites, at all run into the Quakers Blaſphemy; for who doth not acknowledge the Perſon of the Holy Spirit, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt in their Operations, for they are perſonal acts, and therefore the <hi>Perſon</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:97428:43"/> of the Holy Ghoſt dwells in us by his <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c. And in ſumme, we beleeve that that there is a Divine Act or Influence on us, as in Creating ſo in aſſiſting our grace; but our reaction of that grace is not God, but an exerciſe of that principle which is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us, for <hi>Grace</hi> it ſelf is a <hi>Creature</hi> Eph. 4.24.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. Here he chargeth our Doctrine referring to the Divine Decrees, to be the <hi>ſame with that of Ranters;</hi> which is an abuſive ſlander and we ſhall make it appear to be far otherwiſe; for, ſuppoſing them to agree with us in <hi>one</hi> principle, viz. <hi>That God doth all, &amp; hath unchangeably ordered all things good &amp; bad;</hi> are we therefore <hi>Ranters?</hi> We deny not <hi>every</hi> thing that <hi>G.

But had he well ſtudied the Doctrine of <hi>Divine Concurſe,</hi> he would never have ſaid, either, That <hi>If God decrees all things, He muſt needs be the</hi> Doer <hi>of them,</hi> or, <hi>that hence he muſt needs be the Author of Sin, for all our denying any ſuch Conſequences.</hi> This Doctrine is ſo fully handled by all that have written Syſtems of Divinity, or that have waded in Controverſies between us and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97428:43"/> the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians,</hi> that it would be ſuperfluous here to ſearch into it. Let only two or three Concluſions that are to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe be obſerved, Viz. That, firſtly All creatures depend abſolutely upon God, as in reſpect of their Being, ſo of all their Actions, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. 2ndly. That this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is not only for a general ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Being &amp; powers of the Creature, but for influence into every individual Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.11. 3dly. That Notwitſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Influence upon the creature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its Action, the Creature hath its Action of its own, ſubordinate <hi>to,</hi> and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by</hi> this Influence, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. 4thly. That Sin is a moral reſpect which the Action bears as it is done by the creature, who is under the Law, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4 and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch God. And his interpretation of that <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. <hi>that [all things] intends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things that He doth,</hi> is true; but his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>Viz</hi> That <hi>when we ſay a man doth all things by</hi> Wiſdom, <hi>none will be ſo fooliſh as to infer that he doth all</hi> fooliſh <hi>things,</hi> is a fooliſh Similitude: for to argue from a particular Agent to an Univerſal Efficient, by making them paralel, is Folly. Beſides, tho' they are Follies of <hi>ſecond</hi> Cauſes, yet there is the wiſe Conduct, even of theſe things, by the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97428:44"/> 
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> Cauſe; and it is none of the leaſt-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of His Wiſdom, that He conducts the follies of creatures to the Exaltation of His own Glory: but any man may here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he is reſtoring <hi>Manacheiſm</hi> to the world, as if there were <hi>two</hi> principles or firſt Cauſes, the one of good the other of evil.</p>
               <p>That we have him (<hi>page.</hi> 72.) making a large Conceſſion of the Subſtance of what we beleeve, ſeems to intimate that he labours between Conſcience and Intereſt; except it be, that he would perſwade ſilly ſouls to think that we have ſome ſtrange Myſteries in our Doctrine that others cannot ſee.</p>
               <p>But this hath been but a Digreſſion from the matter in hand, Viz. the Univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and now he will glance at it agen: endeavouring to enervate our plea from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. (where he joins us agen with Ranters) by a diſtinction between <hi>Delivering</hi> &amp; <hi>Slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but we ſo diſtinguiſh too, and yet that God only expoſed Chriſt to them, is not the whole meaning of the Text; for it certifies us that this was done according to an eternal purpoſe of God, who had appointed in that way to bring about mans Redemption, uſing them as Inſtruments (tho wickedly abuſing their free will) in theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, by which we were Redeemed. Compare
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97428:44"/> Chapt. 4. Verſ. 27, 28. and it will clearly appear, that God hath certainly decreed all things from Eternity, which come to paſs in time, to him that ſhall conſider.</p>

               <p>Sect. 5. Here we are told that <hi>the honeſt Quakers believe all that the Scriptures ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Election;</hi> and who would deſire more? But if they believe not the things which the Scripture neceſſarily intends, they prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, for the mind of the Word is the Word. and now ſee how it will appear, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, that <hi>We no-where find in Scripture
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97428:45"/> that God reprobated any part of mankind before the foundation of the world.</hi> That He <hi>made 'em on purpoſe to damn them,</hi> is none of our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but Scandalouſly imputed to us: We ſay He made them for the glory of his Juſtice, which is exalted in their Damnation, procured by their own fault; and for proof, follow him but three or four lines, and he confeſſeth as much himſelf, or elſe he ſpeaks he knows not what; for he acknowledgeth <hi>an</hi> everlaſting <hi>counſel about them that Periſh;</hi> yea, (p. 76.) that <hi>Chriſt in His infinite Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice permits ſuch to reſiſt grace;</hi> and had he underſtood himſelf, what could he ſay more, His ſaying that God <hi>conſiders them in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counſil as having reſiſted all grace, &amp; having hardned themſelves finally,</hi> helps him not, for he muſt grant (and does) that <hi>if God had done as much for them, as He doth for his elect, it had been otherwiſe, but becauſe He decreed not to do it, they naturally ly and dy in ſin;</hi> and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly He could not fore-ſee all this but in his own purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And his Aſſertion is extreamly ridiculous, Viz. <hi>That Election and Reprobation are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, and that Election ſignifies a praefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſome before other, it doth not argue a total reprobation of others.</hi> Certainly, if it be to glory that ſome are elected and others are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97428:45"/> not, then they are reprobated <hi>i. e.</hi> God hath not ſeen meet to chuſe them, which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily argues His purpoſe to leave them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſins, and what is this but Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation? He himſelf therefore grants, that <hi>in the end they ſhall be found Reprobates;</hi> and how is that, but by appearing not to have been choſen of God? Eſpecially if it be well pondered what he ſaith concerning God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, p. 76.</p>
               <p>There is a great fallacy lurks in his ſaying, (<hi>p.</hi> 76.) <hi>that as God hath provided grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome ſhall certainly be ſaved; ſo by the ſame</hi> all <hi>are put under a poſſibility; and that they are not, is not for want of</hi> Sufficiency <hi>or</hi> Efficacy <hi>in this grace of its own nature.</hi> We grant there is a ſufficiency in the meanes that God affords to ſave all ſuch as enjoy the Goſpel, i. e. <hi>a ſufficiency of means</hi> Iſa. 5.4. there need no more: nor doth He uſe more with them that are ſaved than with them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, 2. Cor. 2.10.16. But that He hath put a ſufficient efficacy into theſe meanes in reſpect of all that enjoy them, is a paradox, whence is it then that they are not efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? The Efficacy is not in the meanes themſelves, but in the Concomitancy of the Spirit with them to give it, and that is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary: and the very notion of a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97428:46"/> Efficacy</hi> of meanes uſed, without the <hi>Effect</hi> wrought in them with whom they are uſed, is an unintelligible Quakeriſm.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 77. he tells us that <hi>Election goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reprobation, and is not coaetanous with it;</hi> and yet a little before (<hi>pag.</hi> 75.) he owns <hi>Reprobation</hi> (though Conditionally) to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; and who taught him to make Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods in Eternity? Yea, Reaſon it ſelf tells us that in the very nature of Chuſing ſome before others, theſe others are in that very Act and inſtant, neceſſarily left out, which is <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 6. Here he undertakes the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of poor <hi>Infants,</hi> (and it is pitty but they who cannot ſpeak for themſelves ſhould have ſomebody to ſpeak for them) whom he finds ſadly expoſed by this Doctrine of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Reprobation: and is in no little paſſion for them, to think that we ſhould inſinuate that <hi>ſome of theſe are by the decree left finally to periſh:</hi> but though we may and ought to commiſerate them, yet we cannot help them, beyond what God hath purpoſed concerning them.</p>
               <p>His main Labour in this paragraph is to free <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. from a true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and force it to accept of a falſe one: and let us ſee what he hath to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97428:46"/> our gloſſes upon it.</p>
               <p>He tells us that <hi>the Apoſtles deſign is to ſhew that God had choſen the line of Jacob before the line of Eſau, and that only to be His Church in the peculiar diſpenſation of the Moſaical law.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> is here treating of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, hath been fully evinced by many learned Orthodox. That he makes way to this by aſſerting the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, is cleer in the Chapter: That his Inſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> did hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically intend what <hi>G. K.</hi> alledgeth we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not: But here it is to be noted, that there was a <hi>Typical Repreſentation</hi> of greater things in theſe inſtances: &amp; it is the Apoſtles manner to argue from the <hi>Type</hi> to the thing ſignified, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. &amp;c. but what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needs? <hi>G. K. (p.</hi> 79.) <hi>acknowledgeth</hi> that <hi>this was a figure of another thing to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually fullfilled,</hi> and this is it that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle uſeth it for; ſo that we may ſafely argue the thing Typified from the Allegation, it therefore hurts not our caſe, that he ſaith <hi>(ibid.)</hi> that <hi>this doth not infer Eſau's perſonal Reprobation as to his eternal ſtate;</hi> it is enough that there was a Reprobation in the ſame ſenſe that there was an Election. If therefore he grants an eternal <hi>Election</hi> to be typified in it, (as he ſeems to do) the <hi>Reprobation</hi> muſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97428:47"/> be of the ſame kind, elſe there is no paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. It therefore concerns not us to diſpute whether <hi>Eſau</hi> himſelf were ſaved or not: though his Text cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.20. proves it not, for there were <hi>temporal,</hi> as well as ſpiritual &amp; eternal bleſſings: but this whole diſcourſe is aliene, and makes nothing to the purpoſe, and whereas (<hi>p.</hi> 84.) he aſſerts that, <hi>the whole paſſage of</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau, <hi>is a figure of two ſeeds, none of which were reprobated, but the other preferred</hi> is a contradiction, for there can be no Election without Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, chuſing it out of diverſe, and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argues a Leaving.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Sect. 7. We have <hi>G. K.</hi> here ſpeaking the Scripture fair. <hi>The Scripture is a rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and he is for <hi>Scripture Words,</hi> and <hi>it is not ſafe to leave them:</hi> and what is all this for? why, the Scripture indeed acknowledgeth <hi>all</hi> to be <hi>born in ſin;</hi> but what then? Why, the <hi>ſeed or principle of ſin and Corruption</hi> is, <hi>but it is not</hi> imputed, <hi>till men join their Conſent to it, and actually obey it;</hi> and its as clear as mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. and thus he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it; <q>The time of Infancy is the time wherein there is no Law, and therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97428:49"/> (tho children are dead in law) there is no imputation.</q> 
                  <hi>Excellently</hi> well expounded! <hi>Paul</hi> is there proving that there was a law antecedent to the edition of the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his argument is becauſe there was ſin in the world before: and that it is imputed he might have found, if he had read the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, for there we find the ſentence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, which neceſſarily preſuppoſeth impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; nay, the very calling it <hi>Sin</hi> is a charge or imputation, and a ſuppoſition of a Law condeming men for it: nor do his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citations at all prove that <hi>none dye and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh for the firſt ſin, but for actual ſins of their own;</hi> which was now to be proved; for they only intimate that all mens actions are liable to the Judgement, and ſhall be tried and ſentenced; but deny not that man's ſtate in <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be ſo too: Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that men ſhall periſh for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſin, doth it thence follow that men ſhall not ſo for <hi>original</hi> ſin?</p>
               <p>But the knack is, <hi>they died in</hi> Adam, <hi>and Chriſt by His death for all that died in</hi> Adam <hi>hath diſchared all of that Imputation;</hi> which is a perfectly <hi>Arminian</hi> principle, and hath bin enough confuted by all that have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: That therefore he concludes that <hi>none do ſuffer final Deſtruction but for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97428:49"/> the Phyſitian,</hi> makes the condition of <hi>Pagans</hi> better than that of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> for theſe are certain to eſcape deſtruction; being incapable of <hi>rejecting</hi> the Phyſitian who is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offered to them whereas Millions of thoſe do reject Him, and periſh for it. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel then opens a door to man's Undoing, which elſe he had been out of the danger of, if Chriſt had but died for us and never told us of it.</p>
               <p>His wild Aſſertion (<hi>p.</hi> 91.) <hi>That all the children of</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Noah, <hi>have a foederal Holineſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>a ſeed of holineſs in them,</hi> i. e. <hi>a capacity of being made holy</hi> (not to call the Coherence of it in queſtion) ſeems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Apoſtle, who, 1. Cor, 7.14. aſſures us that Unbeleevers children are <hi>unclean,</hi> i. e. not holy; and he there treats directly about foederal holineſs.</p>
               <p>He concludes this Paragraph and Chapter with two Inſinuations (how true, let any judge) 1. That <hi>Grace is propagated by our natural parents.</hi> (how this is, it may be he will tell us next time.) 2. That <hi>there is habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sanctification in all men by nature.</hi> As to the firſt, <hi>David</hi> was of <hi>another</hi> mind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5.

               <p>In this Chapter he proceeds more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to urge and maintain the Doctrine of <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. His firſt and main plea is from the words of Scripture, which expreſs it in Univerſal terms, viz, <hi>All, all men, every man, the world, the</hi> whole <hi>world:</hi> (as for that of the <hi>Body,</hi> Eph. 5.23. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it of the Church, and its ſtrange that the World and the Church ſhould be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual extent) ſome of ours (whom he calls the <hi>Adverſaries of Truth</hi>) have anſwered, (though it is not our whole Anſwer) that by <hi>All,</hi> is not meant all <hi>particulars,</hi> (i. e. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi>) but ſome of all <hi>ſorts,</hi> all the <hi>Elect.</hi> His Reply is, that <hi>the word</hi> [All] <hi>muſt needs be as full and univerſal with reſpect to Chriſt's death and the benefit of it, as it is with reſpect to</hi> Adam<hi>'s Fall:</hi> and who denies it? But it is not ſo in <hi>his</hi> ſenſe, except he will plead
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97428:50"/> for univerſal <hi>Salvation,</hi> as well as Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, elſe the benefit is not parallel to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and ſo he indeed ſeems to plead, by Citing 1. Tim. 4.10. for the proof of his Aſſertion; but yet this he afterwards denies. We are here to conſider, that <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> are in Scripture made parallel in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: as <hi>Adam</hi> is a common Head, ſo is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> hence, as Adam hath a natural ſeed, ſo hath Chriſt a ſpiritual ſeed: as Adam ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined all his ſeed, ſo Chriſt Redeemed all <hi>His:</hi> as Adam's ſeed are called the world, becauſe they comprize all the men and women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world by natural Generation; ſo Chriſt's Seed are called the world, becauſe they comprize all the men and women that belong to the world to come. But then we muſt remember, that Chriſt's Seed are a number ſelected out of the other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though they are <hi>all</hi> becauſe He loſeth none of His Elect, yet not all the Individuals of Adam's poſterity; for there are they of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They are none of my ſheep.</hi> Nor doth he interpret but <hi>pervert</hi> that in, 2. Cor. 5.14. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead:</hi> for the Apoſtles intention there, is to prove that all God's Elect were dead, becauſe Chriſt died for them all: The word <hi>[All]</hi> therefore, doth not ſignifie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97428:51"/> 
                  <hi>ſome,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> that come under that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Whereas Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. makes a Difference between His Redeemed and the world, and ſaith, <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> he would perſwade us, <hi>that</hi> world <hi>is there meant of</hi> final Impenitents, <hi>or ſuch as have finally rejected the meanes of Grace, and with whom the Spirit hath ceaſed to ſtrive.</hi> But not to call over what hath been already of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Viz. That <hi>all</hi> have not the meanes of Grace, and therefore cannot reſiſt them; it is plain that he excludes only the damned from Chriſt's prayer: and hence he inferrs that Chriſt died only for their ſins paſt: Well then, He died for thoſe ſins, and prayed for thoſe men: he then owns His death and prayer to be loſt, and His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption void. Did Chriſt dye to <hi>condemn</hi> men, or to <hi>ſave</hi> 'em? ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. why then are they not ſaved for whom He came to dye? Was He not able to draw them to Him or to ſave them that come, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt?</p>
               <p>That he ſaith, <hi>Many are guilty of final Impenitency a conſiderable time before they dy;</hi> ſeems to be a Contradiction, though he ſaith it is none. We believe indeed that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are left of God to perſiſt in impenitency
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97428:51"/> till they dye; but then they are none of thoſe for whom Chriſt died, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37.</p>
               <p>But we have him acknowledging, (<hi>pag.</hi> 96.) That <hi>He dyed not for all, with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or degree of Love,</hi> and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, that <hi>they that are ſaved have more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant cauſe to bleſs God for His abundant mercy than the other; though they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain.</hi> We grant, the damned have no cauſe to complain, becauſe they ſuffer juſtly: but we would fain know where he placeth the inequality, ſince (at the bottom of the ſame page) he tells us, That <hi>God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no greater meaſure of inward grace to one than to another.</hi> Oh! but he ſuits <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences eminently:</hi> And is this all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? We thought there had been differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſpenſations of grace cleerly intimated in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7 and one would ſurmiſe that what <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaith <hi>(ibid.)</hi> that <hi>God drawes, moves, enclines, perſwades</hi> (and that is more than meer ſwaſion) <hi>them to come, and when they fall infallibly reclaims them, &amp;c.</hi> had been grace, and more than meer Suiting of Providences; eſpecially, when he there alſo tells us, That <hi>He and not</hi> they <hi>made them to differ from others:</hi> and here againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth he bring that to prove his Aſſertion 1. Tim. 1.14,—16. <hi>And the grace of our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97428:52"/> Lord was exceeding abundant with faith &amp; love.</hi> We thought heretofore that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> had been graces: and that God's giving one more abundant grace than another, proves that one hath no more grace given him than another, is not very clear to us as yet. Nay, (<hi>p.</hi> 93.) he tells us, That <hi>God by His infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible perſwaſions of love and grace, prevails in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly with the Elect;</hi> and is not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of grace <hi>grace,</hi> yea more grace than where there is no ſuch Effect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is every mans Duty to improve all the meanes of ſalvation, notwithſtanding he is not ſure of his Election,</hi> is true, but that he can uſe grace to that end, before he <hi>hath</hi> any, is hard to underſtand; he ſhould firſt ſeek for grace, for that <hi>univerſal</hi> grace he ſpeaks of is a meer <hi>Non-entity.</hi> Nor doth our Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Reprobation (as he chargeth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 99.) <hi>make the effectual uſe of meanes abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible to any, ſo as to leave them under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement:</hi> for he himſelf tells us, that <hi>it is the Duty of all men to uſe the means,</hi> and yet he ſaith, that <hi>there are elect, and that none but theſe ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and we ſay the others are the <hi>Reprobate:</hi> and if all are to uſe meanes, and are not diſcharged, though but <hi>ſome</hi> (viz: the <hi>Elect</hi>) ſhall <hi>obtain,</hi> what diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement is their more in our Tenet than in <hi>his?</hi>

He well knew that Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, without ſufficient help, would render his Doctrine ridiculous; here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us, how a ſufficiency of meanes is afforded to all men; and Firſt, That <hi>Chriſt by His Death procured for all men an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of divine grace, light, life,</hi> &amp;c. the Contrary to which is true; He purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe only for his <hi>Elect,</hi> for whoſe ſakes He died. The Scripture makes a difference between his being <hi>head of the Church,</hi> Eph. 5.23. and his being <hi>head over all things</hi> to <hi>the Church,</hi> Cap. 1.22. But ſuppoſing a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, what benefit can they have by it if it be not applyed? Well, he will give an account of <hi>that</hi> too, as good as he can, (<hi>p.</hi> 100) <hi>Where outward meanes fail, God ſupplies this with inward teachings, and ſome other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wayes of Providence:</hi> and are theſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to lead men to Salvation, or bring men to Chriſt? The Apoſtle then muſt uſe a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> Rom. 10.14, 15. And how perverſly doth he interpret Chriſt to be the <hi>word</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Context to mean the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> called the <hi>Word of Faith,</hi> becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of begtting it, <hi>verſ,</hi> 17. he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it of <hi>Chriſt coming in the fleſh, both of Jews and Gentiles;</hi> and is <hi>that</hi> all the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97428:53"/> which he allows to Chriſt? He ſeems to be of another mind, (<hi>pag.</hi> 59.) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we know not when they own any thing. And it was once the received Doctrine of the Quakers, That there is no other Incarnation of Chriſt, but only as He dwells in us; which how ſubverſive it is to our hopes of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let the ſerious judge.</p>
               <p>He miſtakes the meaning of the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,</hi> 2.

He knowes it would be asked him, how any could be ſaved by Chriſt, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of him? and how ſhall they hear without the Goſpel? He therefore antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates it, and anſwers with Railing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Reaſon: only he puts in a Quibble, and thinks he hath tied a knot upon us that is indiſſoluble: We plead for the Salvation of <hi>Infants</hi> by Chriſt; and why may not he with as good reaſon, plead for that of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> The paralel looks but odd; viz. If <hi>Infants</hi> may be ſaved by the working of the Spirit in them, why may not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be ſo <hi>by giving obedience to the light in them?</hi> We might only ſay, they are not cauſes equally

That we deny not the power of God to ſave without out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes; but to argue meerly from His power to His Will, without His own Revelation, is to give laws to the Almighty. 2. That the Infants of Believers are under the viſible meanes of Grace, viz. the <hi>Covenant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and ſo are not the Heathen; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.19. 3.

                  <hi>not in our ſenſe:</hi> Thus far we ſuppoſe he will grant it in our ſenſe; viz. That the <hi>Light within,</hi> is that Diſcovery of divine Truths, which is made to men inwardly, as they came into the world, whereby they are able to know ſomething of God, without outward meanes to acquaint them; or ſomething within them, which doth make theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in them: and this is not any ſpecial, extraordinary Indulgence to ſome, but it is common to <hi>all</hi> men, belonging to <hi>Humanity.</hi> Only herein we differ, and are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: We ſay, That it is nothing but ſome remaines of the Law of nature in the Hearts of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. which they are capable by their Reaſoning Faculty of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving for the making a Diſcovery of many Truths by, which will ſuffice to leave men without excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. [he miſtakes when he thinks we reckon it any <hi>diſtinct fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> the Underſtanding indeed, and in that the Conſcience, is the ſubject of it, but it is ſomething there imprinted.] He on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand tells us that <hi>It is</hi> Chriſt <hi>Himſelf in the man,</hi> and that <hi>it is he who quickens and ſanctifies nature in all men;</hi> and this he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands to be the <hi>Emphutos Logos,</hi> in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. which he faſly renders <hi>Innate word:</hi> it properly ſignifies, <hi>Engrafted,</hi> as our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97428:57"/> renders it; and is a Metaphor from a <hi>Siene</hi> that is grafted into another ſtock than at firſt it grew upon; intimating that the word (whatever it be) is not natural to us, but is ingraffed in us ſupernaturally, and therefore is not put into the nature of all men, and that this word is not Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. and thoſe that follow: it is a word that we are to be the <hi>Learners and Doers of,</hi> it is a <hi>Law of Liberty</hi> that we are to be <hi>looking into,</hi> which cannot be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt: no, not by any tolerable <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Three things, which we will here not only aſſert, but alſo give Scripture proof for. 1. That Chriſt is not the Light of nature in all men. Is it the light in men that was born of a Virgin, hanged on a tree, buried in a grave, all which he elſe-where confeſſeth of Chriſt? Beſides the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, that men in their natural eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate are <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.12. and that <hi>Except men be in the faith, Chriſt is not in them,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. and he tells us that <hi>All have not faith,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. 2. That the Light of Nature left in fallen man, is not ſufficient to point him out the way to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; had not they the Light of Nature of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. that <hi>the Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:97428:58"/> 
                  <hi>has not given them eyes to ſee to that day?</hi> &amp; they to whom Chriſt gave that warning, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.35? Doth not the Apoſtle deſcribe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eſtate by this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. and what ſaies he, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.? but we have him confeſſing this amply in <hi>p,</hi> 120. That man in his ſtate of integrity had Light ſufficient to have guided him to felicity, we believe; but all the Light of nature in fallen man, will not <hi>objectively</hi> reveal the truths neceſſary to be known in order to ſalvation. It had never told men of Chriſt, and the Satisfaction that is made to the Law by his Righteouſneſs. 3. That God hath not any way imparted ſuch a light univerſally to all men; which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Scriptures do prove. Beſides if this Light be connate with men, what needed <hi>G. K.</hi> to make ſuch a ſplutter about <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelations?</hi> and if it be only by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where will he find evidence that God hath ſo reveal'd Himſelf to all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. That from the <hi>Law written in mens hearts,</hi> he goes about to prove that man has ſuch a <hi>ſufficient light,</hi> is weak, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks plain, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. (which we are turned to) of the law given to man at the firſt, which is become weak through the fleſh, and cannot give life; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. And his pleading from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97428:58"/> 
                  <hi>That it is ſufficient to make them inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, that it is therefore ſufficient to make them</hi> excuſable <hi>that frame their lives to it,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not. The fall of man hath left him without ſtrength to obey it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. The Light of Nature diſcovers to man that Duty which he doth not, and, by reaſon of Sin, <hi>cannot</hi> do; which leaves him inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 1.18, 19, 20. but it is Chriſt only that can take off guilt, and remove Condemnation; and the light of nature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovers His perſon, nor the way how to get pardon by Him.</p>
               <p>His arguing (<hi>pag.</hi> 121.) That <hi>Becauſe for mens not glorifying God, He gave them up to a reprobate mind, therefore they were not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates from the beginning,</hi> hath no face of a reaſon in it; for, beſides that (if we ſhould take the word <hi>Reprobate</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. in ſuch a ſenſe) a man may be reprobated before he be left up to make the open diſcoveries of it: the meaning of that place is, that God left them to a mind that choſe droſs rather than Silver, preferred wickedneſs before Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and ſo was a mind diſapproved of God.</p>
               <p>And when He tells us that <hi>The light the Gentiles had is a new gift and grace of God to them,</hi> he ſaith nothing at all till he can
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97428:59"/> prove that there is ſuch a gift common to all men; nor do all his alledged Scriptures ſpeak one word that way: inward convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and warnings of wrath to come (which we deny not to have been in heathen) will not amount to it, being only the Actings of a natural Conſcience under legal Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which indeed ſhew to man ſome of his Miſery, but nothing of his Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>edy: and that place on which he puts a peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <hi>Luc.</hi> 12.20. <hi>God ſaid, thou fool,</hi> &amp;c. is as little to his purpoſe as any; for, if we cannot tell how God ſaid ſo to him, yet it is enough that He did it by awakening of his Conſcience, nay, that he did it Providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and what's this to a ſufficient Light, telling men how they may be ſaved; it is a meer Wheadling and not Arguing.</p>
               <p>It is therefore impudence in him to aſſert (<hi>pag.</hi> 122.) That <hi>though God's Diſpenſations of grace be various, and the Goſpel Diſpenſations</hi> (fine words!) <hi>be beſt; yet whoever is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in any one of theſe is accepted of God; and yet none is accepted but in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>or for His ſake;</hi> and give no other proof for it, but his <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> which is of no value among ſober men: and hence to conclude, That <hi>the inward Diſpenſation that is among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that have not Chriſt outwardly preached,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97428:59"/> hath its glory, and great ſervice to thoſe that are faithful in it,</hi> is to talk at liberty himſelf, and deny to all others a liberty to judge.</p>

               <p>That the <hi>beſt</hi> Dutyes of the <hi>beſt Saints</hi> in <hi>this</hi> life are <hi>imperfect,</hi> and that by reaſon of ſinful mixtures in them; and that daily the moſt holy come ſhort of perfect legal Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; might be charged with <hi>ſin</hi> for their beſt, if God ſhould be ſtrict, we beleeve; &amp; can appeal to the ſenſible complaints of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men in Scripture; but for him hence to infer, that we ſay, that, <hi>the good works of God's Holy Spirit are defiled in &amp; by the ſaints;</hi> and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97428:67"/> to print it in another Character, as our very words, is cheating. But how far our Duties are the work of the Spirit, and how far they are our <hi>own,</hi> has been already diſcuſſed. Its <hi>he</hi> that makes the <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and not we; <hi>we</hi> never ſay, that <hi>One &amp; the ſame thing is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> man <hi>&amp; a</hi> perfect <hi>dog:</hi> We ſay, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Believer in this life, hath a new nature &amp; an <hi>old</hi> in him; a body of <hi>Grace,</hi> &amp; a body of <hi>Corruption:</hi> the one <hi>increaſing</hi> &amp; the other <hi>decaying;</hi> imperfect grace, but <hi>growing;</hi> a body of death, but <hi>dying;</hi> and he is as it were <hi>two</hi> men: and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15.17. Nor do we ſay that the work is <hi>totally perfect,</hi> and <hi>totally ſin;</hi> but we ſay, that the work it <hi>ſelf</hi> is imperfect, by reaſon that, though it be influenced by grace, it is alſo defiled by ſin, being done by one in whom there is both ſin, &amp; the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it into his beſt performances. Nor do we any whit <hi>misinterpret God,</hi> when we ſay, He accepts of theſe works in Chriſt, tho they be defiled: and if he ſhall ſay, that we do therefore ſuppoſe that God accepts of the defilement that is in them, he miſtakes: In all the gracious Actings of Gods people there is Imperfection (now all moral Imperfection is defilement) and God accepts of the <hi>ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> &amp; pardons the <hi>imperfection,</hi> and both in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97428:68"/> Chriſt. And this indeed is the priviledge of the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> above that of <hi>works:</hi> why elſe was the High-Prieſt to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Sanctuary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lev. 16.33. but that the Services, notwithſtanding the <hi>pollutions</hi> (but for which no attonement was needed) might be acceptable? and this was Typical. No doubt but that <hi>God ſees ſin in whomſoever it is,</hi> and <hi>where He ſees it, He</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns <hi>it;</hi> but in reſpect of <hi>Imputation</hi> to the perſon, He does not alwaies <hi>ſee</hi> it, i. e. <hi>charge</hi> it. <hi>Num.</hi> 23.21. and why? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath made Satisfaction and Attonement for it.</p>
               <p>In his Examen of the Scriptures alledged by the Aſſembly, he plays foul with them: he firſt points to three places, where he ſaies they ſpeak of this matter: <hi>Confeſſ. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>fect.</hi> 5. <hi>Larger Catech. Q.</hi> 149. 89. tho' this laſt is on another ſubject. Secondly, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers up <hi>diverſe</hi> matters in <hi>one,</hi> endeavouring to expreſs them in as harſh words &amp; ſenſe as he can. Thirdly in <hi>p.</hi> 155. 156. he gathers up the the whole, and ſaith, <hi>they expreſly ſo word it in Q.</hi> 39. which is utterly falſe, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>he</hi> hath ſo worded it for them, that there are two things Charged on them which they ſay not: viz. 1. That <hi>that they muſt ſin as long as they live;</hi> as if there were a fatal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97428:68"/> neceſſity that God laid them under of ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. That <hi>they are only free from ſinning after death;</hi> whereas they ſay <hi>At</hi> their death. 3. he miſchievouſly perverts the deſign of the Scriptures alledged by them. All the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he animadverts upon, are only thoſe which they annex to <hi>Q.</hi> 49. (omitting thoſe added in the other places.) Let us obſerve, There were <hi>two things</hi> they had to prove, 1ſt. <hi>That no man can in himſelf perfectly keep the law,</hi> 2. <hi>Nor by the Grace of God;</hi> and from theſe principles they infer theſe Concluſions, That <hi>they daily break the Commands in thought, word and deed:</hi> and how pertinent theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to prove theſe two Poſitions may be judged. That Man cannot do it in <hi>himſelf,</hi> one wou'd think that the deſcription given of his natural ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. is ſufficient to demonſtrate. That (as to the latter) he cannot do it by Grace receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth not intend that God cannot give them grace enough, but that He <hi>doth</hi> not, &amp; therefore their imperfect grace cannot attain it. And ſurely that is ſuffiiently proved by ſuch Scriptures as, 1. tell us, That <hi>in many things all do offend,</hi> for which, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.20. 2. That every Beleevers grace depends for its exerciſe upon the help of Chriſt, without which they can do no graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97428:69"/> thing, for which, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. And the Conſectary is not forced, if we conſider, that the Nature of man being ſo corrupt, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men can do no other than daily break the Command; that becauſe Beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are renewed but in <hi>part,</hi> and yet are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive beings in <hi>thinking, ſpeaking, doing,</hi> there will be an Influence of remaining Corruption into theſe <hi>actions,</hi> which will make 'em ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in point of the ſtrictneſs of the <hi>Law,</hi> and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.20. his obſervation, that <hi>the word is in the future,</hi> makes againſt him, intimating that they can do no other as long as they live; and his putting it for the <hi>potential,</hi> is precarious, his applying it to <hi>the times of the Law, which made nothing perfect,</hi> is fond; for they had the Goſpel as well as we, and were perfect in an Evangelical ſenſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.1.

               <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>viſible</hi> Church they ſpeak of; and he alſo after grants that there is ſuch a thing: and what is it that makes it viſible? it muſt be ſomething that makes it diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others: Here then obſerve, 1. That there is inward Grace required abſolutely to make any one a living member of Chriſt, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o of the <hi>church of the firſt-born.</hi> 2. That this ſincerity of heart is to give its evidence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by an anſwerable life and converſation: There is a <hi>confeſſion of the mouth, as well as a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97428:72"/> beleeving in the</hi> heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. 3. Theſe Fruits are they by which others are to judge of mens Sincerity, and accordingly to declare them to be viſible members of the Church: this rule the Apoſtles themſelves followed in their owning of men. 4. That ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion may <hi>be,</hi> where ſincerity is <hi>not;</hi> and thus Hypocrites may belong to the viſible Church; there were ſuch in the primitive times, <hi>Simon Magus, Demas,</hi> &amp; thoſe, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. were ſuch. 5. There may be many Irregularities in the Converſation of ſuch, which yet do not preſently unchurch them; ſuch there were in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatia.</hi> 6. That when ſuch are become ſcandalous, there are Church-<hi>cenſures</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt; and theſe can be adminiſtred to none but under the conſideration of their being Members of the Church viſible: thus <hi>Paul</hi> delivered <hi>Hymeneus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to ſatan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Profeſſion, as it is underſtood by the Aſſembly, is not a meer <hi>verbal</hi> thing, but <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> too: it containes in it an Orthodoxy in the principles profeſſed, and a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion framed thereto, a <hi>profeſſing in words,</hi> &amp; a <hi>not-denying in works,</hi> elſe men are not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtians, but to be <hi>turned from.</hi> 2.

               <p>And it is groſly untrue, that <hi>Independents require no more than ſuch a profeſſion</hi> as he talks of, <hi>to make them members of their church:</hi> for they whom he calls <hi>Independents,</hi> diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church viſible, or Chriſtianity at large, &amp; Memberſhip, or Fellowſhip in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational</hi> Church, and have not been won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97428:73"/> but have held Communion with them, and have admitted their members to Communion with us; although by reaſon of ſome points of Church Adminiſtration, which they differ from them in, in <hi>principle,</hi> they thought they might without any juſt offence do ſo in <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. How daringly doth he here aſſert that <hi>we find no ſuch Church in all the Scripture, owned to be the church of Chriſt, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form or profeſſion of religion makes ſuch;</hi> when the whole New Teſtament acquaints us with no other, if he keep to his ſubject, viz. a <hi>viſible</hi> Church?

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:97428:75"/> and before the end he tells us, that <hi>by the Spirit the man is joined both to Chriſt in</hi> him, <hi>&amp; to Chriſt in</hi> Heaven: and if two Unions, then two Chriſts.</p>

The fault which (in this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph) he finds with our Miniſtry is, that <hi>they are not</hi> itinerary, <hi>as the Apoſtles, whoſe Succeſſors they pretend themſelves to be;</hi> [truly better ſit ſtill in a place; than <hi>go up &amp; down, ſeeking whom to devour</hi>] But may we not ſucceed the Apoſtles in their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> tho' not in their Apoſtleſhip: And do we not find, that though they went about to gather Churches, where there was <hi>none,</hi> yet when they had gathered them, they <hi>ordeined El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>

Cor. 11.26. for how is the Lord's death ſhewed forth in it, but by an inſtituted <hi>ſign?</hi> And when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can ſhew as good a plea for their other five, as we can for theſe <hi>two,</hi> we will then confeſs the injury we have done in denying them.</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. Now for <hi>Baptiſm!</hi> What need he to combat <hi>Infant-Baptiſm?</hi> If there be no <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> then none of <hi>Infants:</hi> only he loves to be wrangling. and what Cavil againſt <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> if neither <hi>that</hi> nor Dipping be of force by Divine <hi>Inſtitution?</hi> Thus ſome <hi>muſt be meddling.</hi>

When be asks us, <hi>Why</hi> John <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Chriſt by</hi> Dipping <hi>Him in Water?</hi> We think his firſt Queſtion ſhould have been, Whether he did ſo or no? and it is certain he cannot prove that he did. Our <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from infant Circumciſion to infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> is good: for, it was the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the ſame promiſes that <hi>Abraham</hi> and we had, <hi>Circumſion was a ſign of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith;</hi> and ſo is Baptiſm; and <hi>Infants</hi> are as capable of the one as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the promiſe is ſtill to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Baptizing of Infants was not the practice of the Church during the firſt century,</hi> is arrogantly affirmed by him, againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> tell us that the Apoſtles <hi>gave order for the Baptizing of Infants:</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells us, <hi>Baptiſm of Infants had

And what a poor ſhift is he put upon, when to evade <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. he acknowledges the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but tells us <hi>it ſaith nothing of water?</hi> doth not the very Word imply it, and the Goſpel aſſure us that <hi>Water</hi> was the Element? Furthermore, We have two Baptiſms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. it muſt then be <hi>one</hi> of theſe two, but the Diſciples could not bapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe with the latter, it being Chriſt's alone prerogative. In citing of <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.15, 16. he fraudulently omits that clauſe, <hi>for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God:</hi> and <hi>G.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97428:78"/> capable: and of the ſame import is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. for all his cavil againſt it? nor doth it follow that <hi>they may receive the Lords ſupper as well;</hi> becauſe that is above their Capacity at preſent: a Child may be an Heir, and yet not be put into actual poſſeſſion of all that he hath a right to: and though <hi>Chriſt Himſelf baptized not,</hi> yet His <hi>Diſciples</hi> did by <hi>His</hi> Authority.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. <hi>That Baptiſm with water properly belonged to</hi> John<hi>'s Miniſtry,</hi> is eaſier ſaid than prov'd: that <hi>It is expreſly contra-diſtinguiſh'd from</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s baptiſm, by</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Chriſt <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> is an errour; the outward Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is diſtinguiſhed from the Efficacy, which depends upon Chriſt, and not on the Miniſter: but not <hi>contra</hi>-diſtinguiſhed, for theſe are two, but not <hi>contraries,</hi> but conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants, as being indeed, two parts of the ſame Sacrament. And that it belonged not limitatively to <hi>John</hi>'s Diſpenſation appears, becauſe Chriſt gave order for the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Philip</hi> baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eunuch with water, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> baptized, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15. Nor will he ever diſprove the <hi>Baptizing with water,</hi> being <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi> Mat. 28.19. till he can prove that there is ſome other miniſterial Baptiſm, for which he muſt run to his Revelations, Ten
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97428:78"/> thouſand of which are worth nothing. And what an infatuation is it to tell us, <hi>there are no other words of inſtitution,</hi> but the words of Inſtitution? What more would he have? Nor doth he evade by telling us, <hi>they could baptize with the Spirit as well as beget ſons and daughters to God;</hi> for this was done miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erially by diſpencing the Ordinances, which Chriſt only can bleſs to that end, though He own His ſervants as workers-together with him in their place; but they ever renounced their doing any of theſe things <hi>by their</hi> own <hi>virtue.</hi> Yea, alſo <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſignified in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. to be one way in which they made diſciples of them: But he fore-ſaw that we would tell him, that the diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt's Diſpenſation, and after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, baptized with <hi>water;</hi> &amp; has provided a fine Evaſion, viz. <hi>It was done by</hi> Toleration, <hi>as many things elſe by the Law;</hi> but we ſuppoſe that Infant-Baptiſm was not of the Law, but of the preparation of the Goſpel: yea, an Inſtitution which Chriſt Himſelf confirmed by his commands, and ſo, not a meer Toleration. And when <hi>Paul</hi> faith, <hi>he was ſent to baptize,</hi> it is meant not ſo much to baptize as to <hi>preach;</hi> he was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle &amp; had diverſe Miniſters waiting upon him, who were ordinarily imployed in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97428:79"/> ſuch as by his Miniſtry were prepared for it: his Thanking of God therefore that he baptized ſo few, was not becauſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance it ſelf was not Authentick, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. but becauſe as there was no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ordinarily for him to do it <hi>perſonally,</hi> ſo it eventually prevented occaſion of their <hi>naming</hi> themſelves from <hi>Paul:</hi> this Reaſon he gives 1.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97428:79"/> thus take away the very means appointed by Chriſt for enjoying that other.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. Nor doth he treat the ſacred Supper with any better language. He grants <hi>That Chriſt had an outward ſupper of the Paſcal Lamb:</hi> i. e. that He had the ſign without the thing Signified; <hi>i. e.</hi> that Chriſt ate the paſſover hypocritically, which is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Blaſphemy. When he ſaith, <hi>Our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath no inward ſpiritual ſignification to us,</hi> he arrogates God's Prerogative, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can judge the heart immediately: and his reaſon is groundleſs, for we never denied <hi>a real and ſpiritual partaking in Chriſt,</hi> though we allow it not in the Quakers carnal ſenſe, but ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>When he takes notice of <hi>Chriſt's drinking firſt, and drinking twiſe at the Sacrament;</hi> he bewrayes his ignorance or perverſeneſs; if that place be more obſcure, it is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by ſuch as are more clear: the other Evangeliſts mention the order of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; By Chriſt's firſt bleſſing and giving the Bread, and after that the Cup; and <hi>Paul,</hi> tells us he received the Order from Chriſt Himſelf thus, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed kept two Sacraments at one Meeting, the <hi>Paſſover</hi> which He now antiquated, and the <hi>Supper</hi> which he now inſtituted; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97428:80"/> Cup belonged to the Paſſover, which alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented Chriſt, and Jewiſh Antiquity tell us, it was their cuſtom to conclude that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with ſuch a Cup.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 188. we have him there introducing a <hi>new</hi> Sacrament, which he tells us they have at their <hi>ordinary Meals,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters do conſecrate them, ſometimes by Praying, ſometimes by ſilence,</hi> (a new way of Conſecration) and to this he ſhrinks up this Goſpel Ordinance; which is pure <hi>Familiſm,</hi> endeavouring to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all inſtituted Worſhip out of the Church, under a pretence of continual holineſs, a fine way to extirpate Religion out of the world, by Evacuating the Appointments of Jeſus Chriſt. We beleeve that there is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feeding on Chriſt, which beleevers are to practiſe daily by the exerciſe of Faith; and are Satisfied that our <hi>Eating &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be alwais <hi>to the glory of God,</hi> and might poſſibly ſay as much of that <hi>as,</hi> and with more truth <hi>than</hi> he. But Chriſts inſtitution is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond that, and is appointed as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial help of our Faith in theſe exerciſes, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in therefore <hi>they are behind us,</hi> they pretend to no more than we do, and in our meaſure endeavour, whereas we are alſo for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Inſtitutions of Chriſt, to help us in all other duties; and we think that our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97428:80"/> is beyond theirs, as being an holy Ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Goſpel Worſhip, and theirs is only the Common duty of all men: we believe that <hi>outward eating is but a</hi> ſign <hi>of the</hi> inward, <hi>and therefore not to be reſted in,</hi> but becauſe it is a ſign: and Chriſt hath enjoined the uſe of it, we dare not omit it.</p>

            <p>VVE had now done with him, but that he hath printed at the End of his <hi>Call</hi> the Copies of three Letters, two of his and one of ours, nor needs much to be ſaid to theſe.</p>
            <p>As to his firſt Letter, all the Reflexion we ſhall here make is, that he tells us in it, that <hi>the falſe Doctrines which he chargeth upon us, were ſuch as he was aſſured by the Spirit of God that we taught them, and that they were falſe:</hi> Now the Spirit of God aſſures none of a Ly, and that in matter of Fact. But we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated, that the 12th. Article in his Charge, is none of ours, but the contrary; by which it appears that <hi>G. K's</hi> Spirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to ly.</p>
            <p>What we have to ſay in Juſtification of our Anſwer to him, will be ſeen in our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions on his reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. he tells us, <hi>We called his letter a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; heretical paper, and give no ſatisfactory
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97428:84"/> reaſon for ſo doing;</hi> We had then no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but we hope we have now done it to the Satisfaction of the ſober.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>When our carnal weapons were gone, we found no ſpiritual ones:</hi> We ſuppoſe it is now evident that he was miſtaken, if the Word of God be the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He vaunts that <hi>We have no courage to appear in the open field, but lurk in our dens where the honeſt Quakers have no occaſion to heare us:</hi> but we ſay, it is their own fault; for our preaching is open, and our doors ſhut out none but thoſe that will not come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He calls us <hi>Beaſts of prey, and Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, that creep out only in the dark;</hi> but this charge is very impertinent and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it was in his Language night with us, when our Liberties were taken away, and then (if at all) we refuſed to come out, and then <hi>G. K.</hi> comes daringly; he then is the <hi>Forreſt-beaſt,</hi> by his own doom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He boaſts of his great Conqueſt in his book, and yet (like an Hypocrite) would arrogate nothing to himſelf, no, he is but like the <hi>Barly cake which tumbled into the hoſt of the Midianites,</hi> only his Conqueſt is not like to hold the parallel, for we ſuppoſe we have

Ought not the Shepherd to be aware when the <hi>Wolf</hi> comes to his flock? Nor did we ever pretend to make our people ſavingly holy, any further than as God bleſſed our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He <hi>wonders we doubted his deſign;</hi> but we knew he was a Quaker.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He tells us that <hi>he came not of his</hi> own <hi>will, but by a neceſſity from the Lord:</hi> but gives no demonſtration.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He <hi>Wrote this treatiſe of the will of the Lord:</hi> and little reaſon to boaſt of that: It was of God (doubtleſs) to leave him in the hands of ſatan to be thus acted: If <hi>we</hi> ſay we have written this <hi>Anſwer</hi> in the will of the Lord, we can give a better account of His approving will in it, becauſe written in defence of the Truth of Chriſt which he has perverted, &amp; the Name of Chriſt which he hath blaſphemed, this moved us to reply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and this is of God.</p>

Nor is there any parallel between his compariſon &amp; the thing, <hi>Turkiſh Pyrats hang out falſe colours and invite men to rob them;</hi> that we do neither, He that will one day vindicate His own truth &amp; ways, will make it appear, then <hi>Wiſdom ſhall he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifyed of all her children;</hi> mean while we take it to be one Commendation of our Doctrine &amp; Miniſtry, that <hi>G.

            <p>But before we part we ſhall, for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſome, who poſſibly are concerned that we took him not up, when he challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to a publick diſputation, ſubjoin our reaſons then moving &amp; ſwaying of us; which were <hi>not</hi> from any ſuſpicion of our own cauſe, nor Fear of his ſtrength of reaſon, or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy leſt our Hearers ſhould be ſeduced; but,</p>

            <p n="2">2. We knew none of our Hearers that had any ſcruple on their minds about any of thoſe Truths which he charged with falſehood, but believed them firmly, as far as we had any knowledge, and therefore to diſpute them for their ſakes, was altogether needleſs.</p>
